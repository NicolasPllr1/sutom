# Sutom

This little project is about playing the [sutom](https://sutom.nocle.fr/) game.
It is similar to wordle but the first letter is known.

I often play this game and wanted to implement an algorithm to play it
'well'. This as strong ties to information theory which is a topic I always
loved studying and thinking about.

My goal was to think about an information theoretic algorithm by thinking
'from first principles' and recollecting what I know about information theory.

For instance, I did not want to re-watch 3b1b video on his wordle implementation.
I will treat myself later with that one. I have already watched it at the time, so everything should already be somewhere in my mind!
